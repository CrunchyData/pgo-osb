Latest Release: v3.1, {docdate}

== General

The *pgo-osb* project is an implementation of the Open Service Broker
API.  This implementation uses the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator as
a means to provision services, in this case the service is a PostgreSQL
database cluster.

*pgo-osb* allows users to also bind to a *service instance* which when
invoked will return PostgreSQL credentials to a user they can use
to connect to the PostgreSQL database instance.

Also, users can *deprovision* a PostgreSQL database cluster using the
OSB API.


The *pgo-osb* broker was developed using the *OSB Starter Pack* and 
associated libraries.
