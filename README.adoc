Latest Release: v4.1.0, {docdate}

== General

The *pgo-osb* project is an implementation of the Open Service Broker
API.  This implementation uses the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator as
a means to provision services, in this case the service is a PostgreSQL
database cluster.

*pgo-osb* allows users to also bind to a *service instance* which when
invoked will return PostgreSQL credentials to a user they can use
to connect to the PostgreSQL database instance.

Also, users can *deprovision* a PostgreSQL database cluster using the
OSB API.


The *pgo-osb* broker was developed using the *OSB Starter Pack* and
associated libraries.


See the following:

 * [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker)
 * [`osb-broker-lib`](https://github.com/pmorie/osb-broker-lib).
 * [`go-open-service-broker-client`](https://github.com/pmorie/go-open-service-broker-client)
 * [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)

== Compatibility

Starting with *pgo-osb* version 4.0.0, the release schedule and version number for *pgo-osb* will be aligned with the release
schedule and version number for the the 
link:https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest[Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator].  Therefore, to ensure
compatibility between *pgo-osb* and the PostreSQL Operator, please ensure the version number for *pgo-osb* matches the
version number of the PostreSQL Operator deployed in your environment.  For instance, if you are using *pgo-osb* v4.1.0, please
ensure the Crunchy PostreSQL Operator v4.1.0 is also deployed in your environment.

== Prerequisites

golang 1.9 or above is required to build this project.

Running the *pgo-osb* service broker assumes you have successfully deployed
the PostgreSQL Operator.  See https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest for documentation on 
deploying the PostgreSQL Operator.

Please note that if *pgo-osb* is deployed to a different namespace than the PostgreSQL Operator, DNS must be utilized when specifying 
the URL for the PostgreSQL Operator API server.  This is done using environment variable `PGO_APISERVER_URL` in the *pgo-osb* 
`deployment.yaml` file (located in directory `$OSB_ROOT/deploy`).  For instance, if the PostgreSQL Operator is deployed to namespace
`pgo`, the `PGO_APISERVER_URL` environment variable would be set in this file  as follows:

```
- --PGO_APISERVER_URL
- "https://postgres-operator.pgo.svc.cluster.local:8443"

```

However, if *pgo-osb* is deployed to the same namespace as the PostgreSQL Operator, then the PostgreSQL Operator service name can simply
be utilized:

```
- --PGO_APISERVER_URL
- "https://postgres-operator:8443"

```

Additionally, *pgo-osb* must also be configured with the certificates needed to properly authenticate into and trust the PostgreSQL Operator
API server.  When installing the PostgreSQL Operator API server these certificates are automatically generated, and must be copied 
into directory `$OSB_ROOT/deploy` prior to deploying *pgo-osb*.  This allows the certificates to be stored in a secret that can be utilized 
by *pgo-osb* when accessing the PostgreSQL Operator API server.  For instance, if the PostgreSQL Operator was installed using the
`bash` installation method, the certificates can be copied as follows:

```
cp $PGOROOT/conf/postgres-operator/server.crt $PGOROOT/conf/postgres-operator/server.key $OSB_ROOT/deploy
```

Or if the PostgreSQL Operator was installed using Ansible, then the certificates can be copied from your home directory as follows:

```
cp "${HOME}"/.pgo/"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}"/output/server.crt $OSB_ROOT/deploy
cp "${HOME}"/.pgo/"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}"/output/server.pem $OSB_ROOT/deploy/server.key
```

This example also assumes you have created a Kube namespace called *demo*.  Adjust
OSB_NAMESPACE to suit your specific namespace value.  And lastly, the example
assumes you are using the PostgreSQL Operator default RBAC
account called *username* with a password of *password*.  If this is not
the case then you will need to adjust the example service instance *service-instance.yaml*.

== Build

To build the *pgo-osb* broker, place these additional environment variables into your .bashrc as they
are used in the various scripts and deployment templates:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/odev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
export OSB_NAMESPACE=demo
export OSB_CMD=kubectl
export OSB_ROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/pgo-osb
export OSB_BASEOS=centos7
export OSB_VERSION=4.1.0
export OSB_IMAGE_TAG=$OSB_BASEOS-$OSB_VERSION
export OSB_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
....

Install the dep dependency tool:
....
mkdir $GOPATH/bin $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata $GOPATH/pkg -p
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
....

Get the code:
....
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/pgo-osb.git
cd pgo-osb
....

== Deploy Service Catalog

Install the service catalog into your Kubernetes cluster by following
this link:

https://svc-cat.io/docs/install/

Instructions on that link are provided to also install the
very useful *svcat* utility for inspecting and working
with the service catalog.

== Deploy

Deploy the *pgo-osb* broker:

....
make setup
make image
make deploy
....

Verify your deployment has been successful with:
....
kubectl get pod --selector=app=pgo-osb
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pgo-osb-69c76578b9-v7s9k   1/1       Running   0          16m
....


== Test

To test the *pgo-osb* broker...

Create an instance:
....
cd $OSB_ROOT
make provision
kubectl get serviceinstance
make provision2
kubectl get serviceinstance
....

_Please note the `ServiceInstance` objects created when running the `make provision` and `make provision2` commands
above will create PostgreSQL cluster's in the default namespace set for the PostgreSQL Operator according to the 
`PGO_NAMESPACE` environment variable set in your environment.  If you would like the clusters to be provisioned in 
another namespace, please set the proper namespace using the `PGO_NAMESPACE` parameter in files 
`$OSB_ROOT/manifests/service-instance.yaml` and `$OSB_ROOT/manifests/service-instance2.yaml`._

You should see a pod with that service instance name:

....
kubectl get pod --selector=name=testinstance
kubectl get pod --selector=name=testinstance2
....

Create a binding:
....
make bind
kubectl get servicebinding
make bind2
kubectl get servicebinding
....

You can view the binding and the generated Postgres credentials
using this command:
[source]
....
# show the binding without secrets
$ svcat describe binding testinstance-binding -n $OSB_NAMESPACE
  Name:        testinstance-binding
  Namespace:   demo
  Status:      Ready - Injected bind result @ 2018-08-24 13:44:29 +0000 UTC
  Secret:      testinstance-binding
  Instance:    testinstance

Parameters:
  No parameters defined

Secret Data:
  secrets    111 bytes
  services   151 bytes

# show the binding with secrets
$ svcat describe binding testinstance-binding --show-secrets -n $OSB_NAMESPACE
  Name:        testinstance-binding
  Namespace:   demo
  Status:      Ready - Injected bind result @ 2018-08-24 13:44:29 +0000 UTC
  Secret:      testinstance-binding
  Instance:    testinstance

Parameters:
  No parameters defined

Secret Data:
  secrets    [{"data":{"postgres":"mu7BDsFi3X","primaryuser":"FHhQwZAeot","testuser":"My2g9BxjFD"},"name":"somesecretname"}]
  services   [{"name":"testinstance","spec":{"clusterIP":"10.104.162.117","externalIPs":[""],"ports":[{"name":"postgres","port":5432,"targetPort":0}]},"status":""}]
....

You can also use the *svcat* Service Catalog CLI to inspect
the service catalog.
