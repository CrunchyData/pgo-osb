Latest Release: v1.0.0, {docdate}

== General

The *pgo-osb* project is an implementation of the Open Service Broker
API.  This implementation uses the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator as
a means to provision services, in this case the service is a PostgreSQL
database cluster.

*pgo-osb* allows users to also bind to a *service instance* which when
invoked will return PostgreSQL credentials to a user they can use
to connect to the PostgreSQL database instance.

Also, users can *deprovision* a PostgreSQL database cluster using the
OSB API.


The *pgo-osb* broker was developed using the *OSB Starter Pack* and
associated libraries.


See the following:

 * [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker)
 * [`osb-broker-lib`](https://github.com/pmorie/osb-broker-lib).
 * [`go-open-service-broker-client`](https://github.com/pmorie/go-open-service-broker-client)
 * [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)

== Prerequisites

golang 1.9 or above is required to build this project.

Running the *pgo-osb* service broker assumes you have deployed
the PostgreSQL Operator to your namespace that you will be
deploying the service broker into.  See https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator for documentation on deploying the PostgreSQL Operator.

This example assumes you have created a Kube namespace called *demo*.  Adjust
CO_NAMESPACE to suit your specific namespace value.  The example
also assumes you are using the PostgreSQL Operator default RBAC
account called *username* with a password of *password*.  If this is not
the case then you will need to adjust the example service instance *service-instance.yaml*.

== Build

To build the *pgo-osb* broker, place these additional environment variables into your .bashrc as they
are used in the various scripts and deployment templates:
....
export GOPATH=/home/yourid/odev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
export OSB_NAMESPACE=demo
export OSB_CMD=kubectl
export OSB_ROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/pgo-osb
export OSB_BASEOS=centos7
export OSB_VERSION=1.0.0
export OSB_IMAGE_TAG=$OSB_BASEOS-$OSB_VERSION
export OSB_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
....

Install the dep dependency tool:
....
mkdir $GOPATH/bin $GOPATH/src $GOPATH/pkg -p
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
....

Get the code:
....
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/pgo-osb.git
cd pgo-osb
....

== Deploy Service Catalog

Install the service catalog into your Kubernetes cluster by following
this link:

https://svc-cat.io/docs/install/

Instructions on that link are provided to also install the
very useful *svcat* utility for inspecting and working
with the service catalog.

WARNING:  we have found issues using Helm 2.10 when installing Service Catalog, we tend
to use Helm 2.9.1.

== Deploy

Deploy the *pgo-osb* broker:

....
make image
make deploy
....

Verify your deployment has been successful with:
....
kubectl get pod --selector=app=pgo-osb
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pgo-osb-69c76578b9-v7s9k   1/1       Running   0          16m
....


== Test

To test the *pgo-osb* broker...

Create an instance:
....
cd $OSB_ROOT
make provision
kubectl get serviceinstance
make provision2
kubectl get serviceinstance
....

You should see a pod with that service instance name:

....
kubectl get pod --selector=name=testinstance
kubectl get pod --selector=name=testinstance2
....

Create a binding:
....
make bind
kubectl get servicebinding
make bind2
kubectl get servicebinding
....

You can view the binding and the generated Postgres credentials
using this command:
....
$ svcat describe binding testinstance-binding
  Name:        testinstance-binding
  Namespace:   demo
  Status:      Ready - Injected bind result @ 2018-08-24 13:44:29 +0000 UTC
  Secret:      testinstance-binding
  Instance:    testinstance

Parameters:
  No parameters defined

Secret Data:
  secrets    111 bytes
  services   151 bytes
[osb@kube11 pgo-osb]$ svcat describe binding testinstance-binding --show-secrets
  Name:        testinstance-binding
  Namespace:   demo
  Status:      Ready - Injected bind result @ 2018-08-24 13:44:29 +0000 UTC
  Secret:      testinstance-binding
  Instance:    testinstance

Parameters:
  No parameters defined

Secret Data:
  secrets    [{"data":{"postgres":"mu7BDsFi3X","primaryuser":"FHhQwZAeot","testuser":"My2g9BxjFD"},"name":"somesecretname"}]
  services   [{"name":"testinstance","spec":{"clusterIP":"10.104.162.117","externalIPs":[""],"ports":[{"name":"postgres","port":5432,"targetPort":0}]},"status":""}]
....

You can also use the *svcat* Service Catalog CLI to inspect
the service catalog.
